Data Size: 4199 * 21
Task: Predict whether the client will subscribe a term deposit based on the bank marketing dataset

In this project, we walk through the whole standard datapipeline from loading data, EDA,... to model deployment. To get the better prediction accuracy, we compare performances of 10 different machine learning models. To know how well machine learning models can achieve, we also compare with baseline models.

Python version: Python 3
Packages Used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- collections
- imblearn
